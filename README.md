## 🎯 The Problem

In many regions, communication during localized emergencies—like flash floods, heatwaves, or industrial incidents—is often fragmented. Information is slow to travel, and citizens lack a single, reliable platform to receive alerts, find safe zones, or request immediate help. **RapAid** aims to bridge this gap by creating a unified digital ecosystem for community safety and rapid response.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

*(Optional, but highly recommended for complex projects)*

The application uses a client-server architecture with Firebase acting as the Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS).

1.  **Client (React App):** Handles all UI/UX. Interacts with Firebase services directly for authentication, data fetching (Firestore), and real-time updates.
2.  **Firebase Auth:** Manages user registration, login, and role-based access (User, Volunteer, Admin).
3.  **Firestore:** A NoSQL database storing user data, incident reports, resource locations, and volunteer information.
4.  **Firebase Cloud Functions:** Used for server-side logic, such as sending out notifications via FCM when an SOS is triggered or a new official alert is published.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

  - Node.js (v18.x or higher)
  - npm or yarn
  - Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rapaid.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project folder:**

    ```bash
    cd rapaid
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**

      - Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
      - Add your Firebase project configuration and any other API keys.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```env
    # Firebase Configuration
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_SENDER_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"

    # Mapbox/Leaflet API Key
    VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN="YOUR_MAPBOX_PUBLIC_TOKEN"
    ```

    *Note: Using the `VITE_` prefix is necessary for Vite to expose these variables to the client-side code.*

5.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
